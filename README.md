# Hair Salon Data - Principal-Component-Analysis
In this particular dataset we have information about a Hair Salon and various features like Customer Satisfaction, Complaint Resolution, Product Quality, Competitive Pricing etc. This dataset can provide an in-depth knowledge about the overall customer experience and various factors that could drive this. Hence, we can do an analysis of these variables step by step from Univariate to Multivariate Analysis and we will also perform a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the data.

Objectives of our analysis

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducting a comprehensive exploration of the dataset to understand the distribution, characteristics, and interrelationships among various variables. • Univariate Analysis • Multivariate Analysis

Identification of Key Factors: Identifying the most influential factors that contribute to the overall customer satisfaction amongst all the other variables.

Performing a Principal Component Analysis (PCA): The primary goal of this report is to leverage Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to identify the key factors that significantly impact customer satisfaction. By reducing the dimensionality of the dataset and extracting the principal components, we aim to uncover the underlying patterns and relationships among the various factors.

Enhance Decision-Making for the Business: By providing actionable insights into the factors driving customer satisfaction, this report aims to empower decision-makers with the knowledge needed to make informed decisions. Whether it's optimizing product offerings, refining service delivery processes, or enhancing complaint resolution mechanisms, businesses can leverage the findings to drive strategic initiatives aimed at improving overall customer experience.
